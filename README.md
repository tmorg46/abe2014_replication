This repo holds all the code from the replication package supplied in Abramitzky, R., Boustan, L. P., & Eriksson, K. (2014). A Nation of Immigrants: Assimilation and Economic Outcomes in the Age of Mass Migration. Journal of Political Economy, 122(3), 467â€“506. https://doi.org/10.1086/675805.

It also holds all the code and most of the data we use to replicate and expand on that paper. :)
